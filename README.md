# Monitor Photovoltaic (PV) System

WIP

# Server Set Up

Servers (I prefer Linux) run an API Server, where the sensors post their data and an InfluxDB to store and analyze the data.

To make things as easy, minimal invasiv and revertable I recommend to run the server and the DB as Docker containers

## InfluxDB

## IoT API Server 

TODO

# Device

The device measures up to 8 voltages and sends them to the IoT Server
